# Main

Datafiles are generated in the following folder structure: YYYY/MM/DDTHH-MM.csv (the leading 0 is not shown yet).

## Notes

When pressing the reset button the clockModule does not update the time.

clockModule has no arduino library in the Library Manager. Using arduino-cli will not work.

## TODO

- [ ] adding stop and start button
- [ ] list all the dependencies
- [ ] arduino-cli fix
